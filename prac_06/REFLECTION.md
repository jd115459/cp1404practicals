Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

spend more time practising.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

time management

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

working from home

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

need to stop procrastinating.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I suggest that just because you have one student saying "how good the interactive classes are and how much help attending the pracs are" doesn't mean it works well for everyone and not giving feedback to students who prefer working from home is really unfair and inconsiderate.
